# CLN8-Mutational-analysis
Python Streamlit app that performs data analaysis on csv data that includes microarray and other analysis on the mutations in patients with CLN8 and other medical diagnosis.

The code appears to be a Streamlit application for performing data analysis on a CSV file containing information about CLN08 mutations. Let's break down the code and explain each section:

Importing Required Libraries:

The code begins by importing necessary libraries such as csv, streamlit, pandas, base64, matplotlib.pyplot, and plotly.express. These libraries provide functionalities for reading CSV files, creating web applications, data manipulation, data visualization, and more.
Function to Read CSV File:

The read_csv function takes a CSV file as input and attempts to read it using the pd.read_csv function from the Pandas library. If successful, it returns the data as a DataFrame. If there's an error, it displays the error message using Streamlit's st.error function and returns None.
Function to Download CSV File:

The download_csv function generates a temporary CSV file and creates a download link for it. It uses base64 encoding to convert the CSV data into a downloadable format. The link is displayed using Streamlit's st.markdown function.
Function to Perform Data Analysis:

The perform_data_analysis function takes the table data (DataFrame) as input and performs various data analysis tasks.
It first displays the table using Streamlit's st.table function.
Next, it calculates the distribution of predicted functional effects and visualizes it using a pie chart generated with Plotly Express.
It then counts the occurrences of each mutation type and displays the counts using a bar chart created with Streamlit's st.bar_chart function.
The top 10 most frequent amino acid changes are displayed in a table.
The user can select a specific mutation type from a dropdown menu, and the filtered data is displayed in a table.
The nucleotide positions are extracted, converted to numeric values, and displayed as a line chart using Streamlit's st.line_chart function. The nucleotide positions are also plotted as a histogram using Matplotlib's plt.hist function.
Additional data analysis and plots can be added for other columns.
The additional information section is displayed in the sidebar using Streamlit's st.sidebar functions.
Main Function:

The main function is the entry point of the Streamlit application.
It sets the titles for the main page and the sidebar.
It allows the user to upload a CSV file using Streamlit's st.file_uploader function.
If a file is uploaded, it calls the read_csv function to read the data and, if successful, calls the perform_data_analysis function to analyze and visualize the data.
Execution:

The code checks if it is being executed as the main script and then calls the main function to start the Streamlit application.
Advantages in the Field of Biology:

The code provides a user-friendly interface for biologists and researchers to analyze and visualize CLN08 mutation data.
It allows users to explore different aspects of the data using interactive widgets, such as selecting mutation types and filtering data.
The code leverages powerful data analysis and visualization libraries (Pandas, Plotly Express, and Matplotlib) to enable comprehensive analysis of mutation data.
The generated charts and tables help in understanding the distribution of predicted functional effects, mutation types, amino acid changes, and nucleotide positions.
The ability to download the analyzed data as a CSV file facilitates further exploration and sharing of the results.
Biological Analysis:

The code focuses on the analysis of CLN08 mutations, which are likely mutations associated with a specific biological condition or disease.
The functional effect distribution provides insights into the predicted impact of mutations on biological processes, allowing researchers to understand the potential consequences of different mutation types.
The mutation type counts help in identifying the most prevalent types of mutations, which can aid in further studies and identification of patterns.
The top amino acid changes provide information about the specific alterations occurring at the protein level, which may have functional implications.
The analysis of nucleotide positions allows researchers to identify any clustering or patterns of mutations along the genome, which can be essential for understanding the underlying biology and potential target regions.
Overall, the code provides a streamlined and interactive platform for biologists to analyze CLN08 mutation data, enabling them to gain insights into the genetic variations associated with a specific condition and facilitate further research in the field of genomics and biology.
